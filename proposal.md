Web App Idea:
Our web app tracks user's habits on their use of computer. The main function of the app is to track the amount of time the user spends on websites and apps they want to keep record of. The web app would act as a homepage for the user that would contain links to sites the user wants to keep track of. There will be a section where the user can view the stats of the sites they have decided to keep track of. A major component of the app will be the ability to compare their web usage with friends and set challenges to see who spent the least amount of time on a site.
